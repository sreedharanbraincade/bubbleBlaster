As a language-agnostic AI, I can provide you with a basic structure of how you can implement the ScoringController in Phaser 3. However, due to the complexity of the game and various factors like game mechanics, player actions, etc., it's hard to provide a near production-ready game code.
Here's a basic structure of how you can implement the ScoringController:
```javascript
class ScoringController {
 constructor() {
 this.scoreMultiplier = 1;
 this.scoreIncrement = 10;
 this.currentScore = 0;
 this.highScore = 0;
 }
 start() {
 this.currentScore = 0;
 this.highScore = localStorage.getItem('highScore') || 0;
 }
 update(scoreIncrement) {
 this.currentScore += scoreIncrement * this.scoreMultiplier;
 if (this.currentScore > this.highScore) {
 this.highScore = this.currentScore;
 localStorage.setItem('highScore', this.highScore);
 }
 }
 getScore() {
 return this.currentScore;
 }
 getHighScore() {
 return this.highScore;
 }
}
```
In your game scene, you can create an instance of the `ScoringController` and call its methods as per your game requirements. For example:
```javascript
class GameScene extends Phaser.Scene {
 constructor() {
 super('GameScene');
 this.scoringController = new ScoringController();
 }
 create() {
 this.scoringController.start();
 }
 update() {
 // Update score based on player actions
 this.scoringController.update(this.scoringController.scoreIncrement);
 }
}
```
Please note that this is a very basic implementation and you would need to adapt it to your specific game needs. For example, you might need to handle different types of scoring increments, multipliers, and game progression based on your game mechanics.
